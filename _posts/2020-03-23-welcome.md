<h2> What this is. </h2>
This is a free & open comedy publication. All posts are original content created by comedians.
- Anybody can submit posts, under your real name or a made up one, doesn't matter.
- Let's get creative with distribution. I'm thinking a newsletter signup, where subscribers receive our front page once a week.  

<h2> Posts </h2>

Recipes, news articles, op-ed, comics, interviews, drawings, videos, photos, jokes, short stories.
As long as it's made by YOU, it has a home here. You can even submit an instagram video you made 3 years ago. Maybe write some context for it. Try to make it good, because my grandma is gonna see it- and she's a big player on the chainmail circuits.

<h2> Front Page </h2>
The Front Page will be a "Weekly edition". On a weekly basis we will put together the best stuff onto one page. It will have a cool layout. It will be clickable & responsive. This is what will get emailed to people.

Something like

I hope this can be a place where comedy lives.  
I hope YOU are compelled to be funny here!
