I"º<h2> What this is. </h2>
<p>This is a free &amp; open comedy publication. All posts are original content created by comedians.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anybody can submit posts, under your real name or a made up one, doesnâ€™t matter.</li>
  <li>Letâ€™s get creative with distribution. Iâ€™m thinking a newsletter signup, where subscribers receive our front page once a week.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Posts </h2>

<p>Recipes, news articles, op-ed, comics, interviews, drawings, videos, photos, jokes, short stories.
As long as itâ€™s made by YOU, it has a home here. You can even submit an instagram video you made 3 years ago. Maybe write some context for it. Try to make it good, because my grandma is gonna see it- and sheâ€™s a big player on the chainmail circuits.</p>

<h2> Front Page </h2>
<p>The Front Page will be a â€œWeekly editionâ€. On a weekly basis we will put together the best stuff onto one page. It will have a cool layout. It will be clickable &amp; responsive. This is what will get emailed to people.</p>

<p>Something like</p>

<p>I hope this can be a place where comedy lives.<br />
I hope YOU are compelled to be funny here!</p>
