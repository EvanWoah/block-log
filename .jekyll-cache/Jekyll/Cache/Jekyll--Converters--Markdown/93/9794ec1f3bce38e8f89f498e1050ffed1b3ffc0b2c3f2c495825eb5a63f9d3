I"D<h2> What this is. </h2>
<p>This is a free &amp; open comedy publication. All posts are original content created by comedians.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anybody can submit posts, under your real name or a made up one, doesn’t matter.</li>
  <li>I want post submission to be a built in feature, but that’s a lot of coding. For now, please send me your posts following this <a href="/2020/postsubmissionguide">Post Submission Guide</a>.</li>
  <li>Let’s get creative with distribution. I’m thinking a newsletter signup, where subscribers receive our front page once a week.</li>
</ul>
